LocatePoints is simple QGIS plugin to create points along lines with given offset and interval.

With LocatePoints plugin you can:

    - choose whether points should inherit attributes from source polylines
    
    - force adding every line endpoint
    
    - define offset and interval parameters
    
    - create points only on selected line features

The resulting layer is 'memory layer' which you can export to different vector format.
